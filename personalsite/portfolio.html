                <p> Here you will find an attempt to categorize many overlapping art and design projects. 
                    This is a FUN job, where we are always working on something new and different. 
                    The majority of the gallery items are customer-initiated projects, for business applications. 
                    Rather than creating in one “signature” style, my work has been as varied as my clients. 
                    Together with them, we’ve created “at least one of everything.”
                    Throughout my career, I have been called on to serve as a one-person art department, working in whatever style or media the customer needs. 
                    At any given time we are developing logos, labels, editorial/book illustrations, publication layouts, brochures, web graphics, large banners…. 
                    if you don’t see a particular style or theme here, just contact me — I have probably done that, too

                    <h3>Inspired logo design & development</h3>
                    <p> We’ve developed over 300 logos, created complex brand architectures, won logo design awards but what matters most- the next logo we design.
    
                        Why? Creating logos is the holy grail for a branding agency.  
                        Being a part of a logo design is like being part of the birth of a child- 
                        it’s an inspired opportunity, it’s the ultimate challenge, it’s a bestowed honor and for our designers it’s how they earn there stripes.  
                        A logo’s visibility is undeniable from websites and advertisements to signs and business cards a logo is the foundation of a brand.  
                        Knowing this we approach every logo design with an inspired dedication.
                        
                        When it comes to logo design, we have the right approach and we have some of the most talented designers on the web but this does not make a logo design strategy. 
                         To have successful results, to create award winning designs and to consistently impress our clients it comes down to having a repeatable process. 
                          At Vital we have honed our process over time and it is the only way we know to be successful every time.  </p>
